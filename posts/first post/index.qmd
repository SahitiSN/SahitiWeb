Hey, it's Sahiti Nallamudi, which you can probably tell from the URL. I'm currently a junior in high school, and I am an avid reader! I'm hoping to make this my place to talk about books and give my own thoughts about them. As a junior, though, I have to bring up the horrors of college prep every once in a while, so I won't refrain from that! I promise I'll link the two though! üññüèº Off to the stars!
