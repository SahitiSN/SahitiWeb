<p>What a way the kick off the new year! We‚Äôve spent the past two years contemplating life as we know it, and it seems fitting to enter 2023, a year that should be free of these shackles, with a reminder of all that we‚Äôve learned condensed into a trilogy. A companion novel has been released recently, but given the long hold wait, I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôll be able to read it any time soon. Nevertheless, the trilogy itself gives a well-rounded conclusion, and though I do want to continue inhabiting that world, I have no hard feelings after leaving it.</p>
<p>Far into the future, the internet cloud has evolved into the Thunderhead, an AI that presides over the world with it‚Äôs just and compassionate hands, making only correct decisions and keeping the world running long past our date of death. Disease has been eradicated, and with it, death, though groups of people called <em>scythes</em> keep the population in check by ‚Äúgleaning‚Äù ‚Äì killing ‚Äì a certain number of people, provided by the Thunderhead. But like any human organization, it is riddled with corruption, and since the Thunderhead leaves matters of life and death in the hands of the humans who experience it, it cannot make direct change. So it‚Äôs up to Citra and Rowan, two scythe apprentices, who each become scythes in their own way, to make change.</p>
<p>I know we‚Äôre all expecting a romance between them, because that‚Äôs what‚Äôs expected in a book like this, but I honestly wish it would‚Äôve been left out ‚Äì it‚Äôs boring, shallow, and under-developed. Maybe it‚Äôs just me, but I can‚Äôt see a world-shattering, mountain-moving love from two teenagers who know next to nothing about each other. The romance subplot between them feels thin, especially compared to the romance we see later between two elder scythes, a truly forbidden love and as deep as they are old. Besides that bogging down the novels, the story arc (pun not intended) itself is engaging and well-thought-out, even and interesting, the twists both unexpected and consistent with the characters. The villain is someone we may have collectively seen in the past few years, and so our hatred for him may be just as strong. Take your time with this series, as the characters don‚Äôt value the time they have. The prose explores just how much we lose when we lose the light of life in contrast to the darkness of death, and what the consequences are when we try, corruptly, to get it back. The trilogy is compelling and considerate, an analysis of humanity and our downfalls and upside ‚Äì a great start to a new year.</p>

  <title>The Raven Cycle by Maggie Stiefvater</title>

<p>To say this year was busy is an understatement, and nothing proves it more than these last few vestiges of 2022. In the midst of chaos, there‚Äôs no better way to end it with the Raven Cycle, a fantasy trilogy with one companion novel from my newly beloved Maggie Stiefvater, an author who seems to me to be blessed by some unknown god to write like she does. Ladies and gentlemen, I <em>ate</em> these novels.</p>
<p>Let me preface by saying the first book had been left open to page 10 for about six months, if I‚Äôm being generous ‚Äì a combination of work, school, studying, distraction, exhaustion, and, I‚Äôll admit, a little laziness made sure the book collected dust in the internet cloud it rented out for half a year on my iPad. And then, the end of the school coincided with the release of test scores (can I get a collective, <em>ugh standardized testing</em>?) and most of my other obligations faded away for a blissful two weeks, the first five days of which I spent blowing through this series. You heard that right ‚Äì five days, for four books. I wasn‚Äôt kidding when I said I ate them. Meet Blue Sargent, a girl so human she feels otherworldly, and every instinct you have about her will be correct. Gansey, Mr.&nbsp;Richie Rich with a heart of gold and eyes of steel ‚Äì a boy broken in all the wrong places. Adam Parrish, a character who read to me like reading my own diary ‚Äì too similar to be real, too different to care. Ronan Lynch, my favorite type of character; broken beyond repair but trying anyway.</p>
<p>Gansey and his merry thieves are in search of a Welsh king who‚Äôs been asleep for centuries, outwardly telling people they want the wish he‚Äôll grant when he wakes, but really just doing it because their souls tell them they must. But Blue knows something they don‚Äôt ‚Äì Gansey will die by the year‚Äôs end. Suddenly, their quest has a deadline no one but her knows about, and Blue‚Äôs deadline might overlap with it ‚Äì she‚Äôs cursed to kill her true love with a kiss, and she‚Äôll fall in love by this year. This plotline is fairly predictable, but the implications for their main plotline are endless and twisty, unimaginable to anyone but Stiefvater, in her heavy, soft, and poignant prose, tying a leash around your neck while you bounce merrily along.</p>
<p>I‚Äôll leave the blurbs to tell you more about the story, but these books are the kinds that burrow into your heart to tug at your arteries. Magic doesn‚Äôt seem any more imaginary than phones, which seem out of place and out of time in an ageless story woven with dreams. If you have a few days to spare, I recommend flying through this series as I did. They‚Äôre books that will stay with you forever, even when you forget them. Like a dream.</p>

<p>Hey, it‚Äôs Sahiti Nallamudi, which you can probably tell from the URL. I‚Äôm currently a junior in high school, and I am an avid reader! I‚Äôm hoping to make this my place to talk about books and give my own thoughts about them. As a junior, though, I have to bring up the horrors of college prep every once in a while, so I won‚Äôt refrain from that! I promise I‚Äôll link the two though! üññüèº Off to the stars!</p>
